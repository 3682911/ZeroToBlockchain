# ZeroToBlockchain
Tutorial on getting started with IBM Blockchain using HyperLedger Composer V 0.13 running on Hyperledger Fabric V 1.0 or higher. 

This is **V0.11**, which means that the tutorial code and documentation is complete through Chapter 11. 
 - This will be updated to V1.0 when Chapter 12 code is complete.
 - and to V1.1 when support for version 0.14 of HyperLedger Composer is available. Composer V0.14 was a 'breaking' release, which means that it implemented security in a manner which broke all previous Composer implementations.  

Support for HyperLedger Composer V1.0 (not yet released) will be implemented shortly after it is released
